American Alice's McGee Version 2.5

This will look through all of the IC forums in the board, and figure out which players are inactive.

For more on how to use the config file, look in the sample config file included, as it sometimes changes.

The output will be put into output.txt in whatever folder you run the program from.

To run McGee with GUI only, double-click on the .jar archive.

If you want command-line output under windows, use the provided windows batch file. This can be helpful if you suspect some errors.

Due to filepath issues, you should use the linux shell script regardless of whether or not you want the command line output if you are running McGee under linux.

If you mess up and save a table when you didn't mean to, don't panic! Every time a scan is run, a backup of the current table is saved to players.bak.

If you find yourself in such a situation, rename players.bak to players.txt and the old data will be restored!
